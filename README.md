# Milepost 7
Milepost 7 is an application of the ECP ExaSGD project to solve multiperiod security-constrained optimal power flow (MPSCOPF) at a large-scale on GPU
architectures.

## Dependencies
Milepost 7 depends on the following packages:
- [ProxAL.jl](https://github.com/exanauts/ProxAL.jl)
- [ExaAdmm.jl](https://github.com/exanauts/ExaAdmm.jl)
- [ExaPF.jl](https://github.com/exanauts/ExaPF.jl)

## Installation
These packages and sub-dependencies will be pulled automatically when installing
Milepost 7. To instantiate all the submodules, run the following command:
```julia
] up
```
Manifest files for Polaris (ALCF), Summit (OLCF), and Frontier (OLCF) are
provided that have been used to run on these systems.

## Data format
### Contingencies
Milepost 7 supports N-x contingencies, though no convergence is guaranteed in
this case. The format for the contingencies is (lines, columns) =
(contingencies, lines).

### Load data
Load data is stored in two files for the P and Q load, respectively. The format
is (lines, columns) = (buses, periods).

The load data for the ACTIVSg2000 and ACTIVSg10k case have been generated by
NREL and provided in CSV format. To convert these load files into the format
used by Milepost 7, run the following command in the `data` directory
environment:
```julia
julia --project pdqdfromcsv.jl --help
usage: pdqdfromcsv.jl [--plot] [-h] case Pd Qd

positional arguments:
  case        Case file
  Pd          Pd load file
  Qd          Qd load file

optional arguments:
  --plot      Create a plot of the load
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
